                        Where time is money, the Aadhaar Empowered Payment System (AEPS) is a revolutionary payment
                        model that enables online interoperable financial transactions. AEPS is a bank-led model that
                        allows you to perform a range of financial transactions using Aadhaar verification.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-justify">
                        The AEPS works through MicroATM terminals connected to the Aadhaar authentication server.
                        Once the authentication is successful, the transaction is processed, debiting or crediting
                        the customer's account accordingly.
